        <p>
          My name is Akcholpon Usenbekova, and I was born in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan
          — a beautiful city surrounded by mountains and rich in history and
          culture. Bishkek is known for its friendly people, lively markets, and
          stunning natural landscapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have some experience in frontend engineering after completing a
          coding bootcamp, where I developed skills in building user-friendly
          and responsive web interfaces. However, I realized that to grow
          further in my career, I need more formal education and qualifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason, I am currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree to deepen
          my knowledge and open up more opportunities for career growth in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am passionate about learning and excited to keep improving my skills
          and contributing to great projects in the future.
